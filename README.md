# Machine-Learning-Project

Our model predits the price of the land using the BOSTON HOUSING DATASET....
The RMSE of the MODEL is 3.5627429397729444

Here we have used Linear Regression and Decision Tree Algorithm but in Decision Tree we are getting the less RMSE which means the model is performing better than the Linear Regression Model.
